# SETUP WHATSAPP GATEWAY (Run as Separate Deployment)

To use the WhatsApp features (Login & Notification), you need to run the `wa-gateway` service.
The source code has been cloned to: `c:\xampp\htdocs\wa-gateway`

## Prerequisites
1.  **Node.js**: You must have Node.js installed.
    -   Download specific version (LTS recommended): https://nodejs.org/
    -   Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type `node -v` and `npm -v`.

## Installation & Running
1.  Open Command Prompt (Terminal).
2.  Navigate to the gateway directory:
    ```bash
    cd c:\xampp\htdocs\wa-gateway
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the service:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    The service should show "Running on port 5001" (or similar).

## Connecting
1.  Go to your SIM Sekolah Admin Panel.
2.  Navigate to **WhatsApp Gateway** menu.
3.  Click "Connect".
    -   This will trigger the session start on the gateway.
    -   The QR Code should appear (or instructions to scan).
4.  Scan the QR with your phone's WhatsApp (Linked Devices).

## Note
-   Keep the Command Prompt open to keep the gateway running.
-   If you want to run it in background, look into `pm2` or similar tools for Node.js.
